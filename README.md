# F1TeamManagement

Using Oracle IAcademy platform, we created a relational database for a fictional Formula One team.

The database includes tables for things such as componens (how many of the same component, how many of them are new, what department do they belong to) to whole departments, engineers that are assigned to one department or component, expenses, cars and drivers, R&D status for new components etc.
